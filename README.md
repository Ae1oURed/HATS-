hello! i highly recommend you to go into my repositories and get HATSLINKED! hats+ is mainly going to be used to hold files instead of being the main folder!
if you want to experiment and edit the files, both the textures and meshes are in this repository!

NovetusFE has been declared dead software by its author, thank you lachrymogenic for helping with many of my problems when i joined novetus and being a good friend.
