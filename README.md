hello! i highly recommend you to go into my repositories and get HATSLINKED! hats+ is mainly going to be used to hold files instead of being the main folder!
if you want to experiment and edit the files, both the textures and meshes are in this repository!

*WARNING* hats+ is still linekd to novetusFE workshop, so downloading the files from there will NOT give you the newer RBXM files, just the textures and fonts!
